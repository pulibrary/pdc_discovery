<h2>About Princeton's Research Data Repository</h2>
<p>Our multidisciplinary digital repository offers expert curation services and is designed to archive and publicly 
    disseminate data and code that are the result of research activities by Princeton University's research community.</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
In April 2024, Princeton University Library launched Princeton Data Commons, a new custom built data repository which
  replaced DataSpace. We are working to improve upon this first release and welcome feedback at
  <a href="mailto:prds@princeton.edu">prds@princeton.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Why does Princeton University have an online data repository?</h3>
<p>Princeton University is committed to supporting research that has the potential to benefit humanity at large. Very often, 
  research conducted by members of the Princeton community is publicly funded and therefore entails an explicit responsibility 
  to share the products of the research openly with taxpayers. Some academic journals have data policies requiring that the 
  evidence backing submitted research papers be posted online for peer review and public scrutiny. An increasing number of 
  Princeton researchers also embrace the principles of open research in general, committing to share their data and/or code 
  for the sake of transparency, accountability, and the democratization of knowledge, regardless of whether their funders and 
  publishers require it. This repository exists to support long-term archiving and open dissemination of any digital research 
  product from the Princeton community, meeting funder and publisher policies, as well as open research principles.<p>

<h3>Who has access to items in the repository?</h3>
<p>Anyone can browse, download, and investigate the items, free of charge. Many, if not most, of these items have an 
    intended audience of specialists in a given field of research, and users should be cautioned that individual contributors 
    typically retain copyrights to their research works. Permissions may be required for some forms of use and re-use, 
    depending on the item.</p>

<h3>Who manages Princeton's Research Data Repository?</h3>
<p>Data are curated and published by the <a href="https://researchdata.princeton.edu/">Princeton Research Data Service</a>
    (PRDS), with technical and infrastructure support from information technology staff at the Princeton University Library. 
    PRDS curators review submissions with an eye toward discoverability, reusability, and long-term preservation; without 
    partiality to the subject matter or findings of the research.</p>

    <p>For general questions related to the repository, please contact 
      <a href="mailto:prds@princeton.edu">prds@princeton.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>About the Princeton Data Commons (PDC) project</h3>
<p>The Princeton Data Commons is a project to create an ecosystem of online resources and tools to support and advance
    storing, preserving, managing, sharing, and curating digital research data. For more information about the PDC project, 
    please contact Meghan Testerman, Head of Princeton Research Data Service 
    (<a href="mailto:mtesterman@princeton.edu">mtesterman@princeton.edu</a>).</p>
