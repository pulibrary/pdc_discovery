<h2>About Princeton's Research Data Repository</h2>
<p>Our multidisciplinary digital repository offers expert curation services and is designed to archive and publicly 
    disseminate data and code that are the result of research activities by Princeton University's research community.</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
The Princeton research data repository has a new front-end, called Princeton Data Commons: Discovery. This is an early 
    release of our evolving discovery layer, and we are welcoming feedback from everyone. Please email us at 
    <a href="mailto:prds@princeton.edu">prds@princeton.edu</a> with any questions or comments.</p>

<h3>Why does Princeton University have an online data repository?</h3>
<p>Princeton University is committed to supporting research that has the potential to benefit humanity at large. 
    Very often, research conducted by members of the Princeton community is publicly funded and therefore entails an 
    explicit responsibility to share the products of the research openly with taxpayers. Some academic journals have 
    data policies requiring that the evidence backing submitted research papers be posted online for peer review and 
    public scrutiny. An increasing number of Princeton researchers also embrace the principles of open research in general, 
    committing to share their data and/or code for the sake of transparency, accountability, and the democratization of 
    knowledge, regardless of whether their funders and publishers require it. This repository exists to support long-term 
    archiving and open dissemination of any digital research product from the Princeton community, meeting funder and 
    publisher policies, as well as open research principles.<p>

<h3>Who has access to items in the repository?</h3>
<p>Anyone can browse, download, and investigate the items, free of charge. Many, if not most, of these items have an 
    intended audience of specialists in a given field of research, and users should be cautioned that individual contributors 
    typically retain copyrights to their research works, so permissions may be required for some forms of use and re-use, 
    depending on the item.</p>

<h3>Who manages Princeton's Research Data Repository?</h3>
<p>Data are curated and published by the <a href="https://researchdata.princeton.edu/">Princeton Research Data Service</a>
    (PRDS), with technical and infrastructure support from information technology staff at the Princeton University Library. 
    PRDS curators review submissions with an eye toward discoverability, reusability, and long-term preservation - without 
    partiality to the subject matter or findings of the research.</p>

    <p>For general questions related to the repository, please contact the curators.</p>

<h3>About the Princeton Data Commons (PDC) project</h3>
<p>The Princeton Data Commons is a project to create an ecosystem of online resources and tools to support and advance
    storing, preserving, managing, sharing, and curating digital research data. Princeton Data Commons - Discovery
    is the first application in this new ecosystem. For more information about the PDC project, please contact Wind
    Cowles, Director of Research Data and Open Scholarship
