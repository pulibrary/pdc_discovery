{"resource":{"titles":[{"title":"Energetic particle optimization of quasi-axisymmetric stellarator equilibria","title_type":null}],"description":"An important goal of stellarator optimization is to achieve good confinement of\r\nenergetic particles such as, in the case of a reactor, alphas created by Deuterium-Tritium\r\n(D-T) fusion. In this work, a fixed-boundary stellarator equilibrium was re-optimized for\r\nenergetic particle confinement via a two-step process: first, by minimizing deviations from quasi-axisymmetry (QA) on a single flux surface near the mid-radius, and secondly by maintaining this improved quasi-axisymmetry while minimizing the analytical quantity ΓC , which represents the angle between magnetic flux surfaces and contours of J||, the second adiabatic invariant.This was performed multiple times, resulting in a group of equilibria with significantly reduced energetic particle losses, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations of alpha particles in scaled-up versions of the equilibria. This is the first time that energetic particle losses in a QA stellarator have successfully been reduced by optimizing ΓC . The relationship between energetic particle losses and metrics such as QA error (Eqa) and ΓC in this set of equilibria were examined via statistical methods and a nearly linear relationship between volume-averaged ΓC and prompt particle losses was found.\r\n\r\nData for all figures in \"Energetic particle optimization of quasi-axisymmetric stellarator equilibria\" by LeViness et al., accepted by Nuclear Fusion 2022.","collection_tags":[],"creators":[{"value":"LeViness, Alexandra","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Alexandra","family_name":"LeViness","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-2552-0411","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":0},{"value":"Schmitt, John","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"John","family_name":"Schmitt","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-9137-9540","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[],"sequence":1},{"value":"Lazerson, Samuel","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Samuel","family_name":"Lazerson","identifier":{"value":"0000-0001-8002-0121","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[],"sequence":2},{"value":"Bader, Aaron","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Aaron","family_name":"Bader","identifier":null,"affiliations":[],"sequence":3},{"value":"Faber, Benjamin","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Benjamin","family_name":"Faber","identifier":{"value":"0000-0003-4934-400X","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[],"sequence":4},{"value":"Hammond, Kenneth","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Kenneth","family_name":"Hammond","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-1104-4434","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":5},{"value":"Gates, David","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"David","family_name":"Gates","identifier":{"value":"0000-0001-5679-3124","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":6}],"resource_type":"Dataset","resource_type_general":"Dataset","publisher":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University","publication_year":"2022","ark":"ark:/88435/dsp012n49t492r","doi":"10.34770/wnjn-m776","rights_many":[{"identifier":"CC BY","uri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"}],"version_number":"1","related_objects":[{"related_identifier":"10.1088/1741-4326/aca4e3","related_identifier_type":"DOI","relation_type":"IsReferencedBy","valid_type_values":["ARK","arXiv","bibcode","DOI","EAN13","EISSN","Handle","ISBN","ISSN","ISTC","LISSN","LSID","PMID","PURL","UPC","URL","URN","IGSN","w3id"],"valid_related_identifier_type":true,"valid_relationship_types":["IsCitedBy","Cites","IsSupplementTo","IsSupplementedBy","IsContinuedBy","Continues","HasMetadata","IsMetadataFor","IsNewVersionOf","IsPreviousVersionOf","HasVersion","IsVersionOf","IsPartOf","HasPart","IsReferencedBy","References","IsDocumentedBy","Documents","IsCompiledBy","Compiles","IsVariantFormOf","IsOriginalFormOf","IsIdenticalTo","IsReviewedBy","Reviews","IsDerivedFrom","IsSourceOf","IsObsoletedBy","Obsoletes","IsDescribedBy","Describes","IsRequiredBy","Requires"],"valid_relation_type":true,"errors":[]}],"keywords":[],"contributors":[],"organizational_contributors":[],"funders":[{"ror":"https://ror.org/01bj3aw27","funder_name":"United States Department of Energy","award_number":"DE-AC02-09CH11466","award_uri":""}],"domains":["Natural Sciences"],"communities":["Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory"],"subcommunities":["Advanced Projects","Stellarators"],"migrated":true},"files":[{"filename":"10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/README.txt","size":9384,"display_size":"9.16 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/README.txt"},{"filename":"10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/data.zip","size":64194,"display_size":"62.7 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/data.zip"},{"filename":"10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/license.txt","size":3223,"display_size":"3.15 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.34770/wnjn-m776/60/license.txt"}],"group":{"title":"Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL)","description":null,"code":"PPPL","created_at":"2022-04-28T16:30:00.195-04:00","updated_at":"2023-05-18T14:20:45.272-04:00"}}
