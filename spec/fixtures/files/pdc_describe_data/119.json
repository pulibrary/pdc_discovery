{"resource":{"titles":[{"title":"Effect of progressively increasing lithium conditioning on edge transport and stability in high triangularity NSTX H-modes","title_type":null}],"description":"A sequence of H-mode discharges with increasing levels of pre-discharge lithium evaporation ('dose') was conducted in high triangularity and elongation boundary shape in NSTX. Energy confinement increased, and recycling decreased with increasing lithium dose, similar to a previous lithium dose scan in medium triangularity and elongation plasmas. Data-constrained SOLPS interpretive modeling quantified the edge transport change: the electron particle diffusivity decreased by 10-30x. The electron thermal diffusivity decreased by 4x just inside the top of the pedestal, but increased by up to 5x very near the separatrix. These results provide a baseline expectation for lithium benefits in NSTX-U, which is optimized for a boundary shape similar to the one in this experiment.\r\n","collection_tags":[],"creators":[{"value":"Maingi, R.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"R.","family_name":"Maingi","identifier":{"value":"0000-0003-1238-8121","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":0},{"value":"Canik, J.
