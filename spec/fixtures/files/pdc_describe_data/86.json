{"resource":{"titles":[{"title":"Reduced Physics Model of the Tokamak Scrape-off-Layer for Pulse Design","title_type":null}],"description":"The dynamic interplay between the core and the edge plasma has important consequences in the confinement and heating of fusion plasma. The transport of the Scrape-Off-Layer (SOL) plasma imposes boundary conditions on the core plasma, and neutral transport through the SOL influences the core plasma sourcing. In order to better study these effects in a self-consistent, time-dependent fashion with reasonable turn-around time, a reduced model is needed. In this paper we introduce the SOL Box Model, a reduced SOL model that calculates the plasma temperature and density in the SOL given the core-to-edge particle and power fluxes and recycling coefficients. The analytic nature of the Box Model allows one to readily incorporate SOL physics in time-dependent transport solvers for pulse design applications in the control room. Here we demonstrate such a coupling with the core transport solver TRANSP and compare the results with density and temperature measurements, obtained through Thomson scattering and Langmuir probes, of an NSTX discharge. Implications for future interpretive and predictive simulations are discussed.","collection_tags":[],"creators":[{"value":"Zhang, Xin","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"Xin","family_name":"Zhang","identifier":{"value":"0000-0003-3775-5821","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":0},{"value":"Poli, F.
