{"resource":{"titles":[{"title":"Collisional dependence of Alfven mode saturation in tokamaks","title_type":null}],"description":"Saturation of Alfv√©n modes driven unstable by a distribution of high energy particles as a function of collisionality is investigated with a guiding center code, using numerical eigenfunctions produced by linear theory and numerical high energy particle distributions. The most important resonance is found and it is shown that when the resonance domain is bounded, not allowing particles to collisionlessly escape, the saturation amplitude is given by the balance of the resonance mixing time with the time for nearby particles to collisionally diffuse across the resonance width. Saturation amplitudes are in agreement with theoretical predictions as long as the mode amplitude is not so large that it produces stochastic loss from the resonance domain.","collection_tags":[],"creators":[{"value":"Zhou, M.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"M.","family_name":"Zhou","identifier":null,"affiliations":[],"sequence":0},{"value":"White, R.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"R.","family_name":"White","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-4239-2685","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":1}],"resource_type":"Dataset","resource_type_general":"Dataset","publisher":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University","publication_year":"2016","ark":"ark:/88435/dsp01hx11xh689","doi":"10.11578/1367170","rights_many":[{"identifier":"CC BY","uri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"}],"version_number":"1","related_objects":[{"related_identifier":"10.1088/0741-3335/58/12/125006","related_identifier_type":"DOI","relation_type":"IsCitedBy","valid_type_values":["ARK","arXiv","bibcode","DOI","EAN13","EISSN","Handle","ISBN","ISSN","ISTC","LISSN","LSID","PMID","PURL","UPC","URL","URN","IGSN","w3id"],"valid_related_identifier_type":true,"valid_relationship_types":["IsCitedBy","Cites","IsSupplementTo","IsSupplementedBy","IsContinuedBy","Continues","HasMetadata","IsMetadataFor","IsNewVersionOf","IsPreviousVersionOf","HasVersion","IsVersionOf","IsPartOf","HasPart","IsReferencedBy","References","IsDocumentedBy","Documents","IsCompiledBy","Compiles","IsVariantFormOf","IsOriginalFormOf","IsIdenticalTo","IsReviewedBy","Reviews","IsDerivedFrom","IsSourceOf","IsObsoletedBy","Obsoletes","IsDescribedBy","Describes","IsRequiredBy","Requires"],"valid_relation_type":true,"errors":[]}],"keywords":["TAE modes","Saturation","Tokamaks"],"contributors":[],"organizational_contributors":[],"funders":[{"ror":"https://ror.org/01bj3aw27","funder_name":"United States Department of Energy","award_number":"DE-AC02-09CH11466","award_uri":""}],"domains":["Natural Sciences"],"communities":["Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory"],"subcommunities":["NSTX","Spherical Torus"],"migrated":true},"files":[{"filename":"10.11578/1367170/112/ARK_DATA.zip","size":341268,"display_size":"333 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.11578/1367170/112/ARK_DATA.zip"},{"filename":"10.11578/1367170/112/readme (1).txt","size":1136,"display_size":"1.11 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.11578/1367170/112/readme%20%281%29.txt"}],"group":{"title":"Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL)","description":null,"code":"PPPL","created_at":"2022-04-28T16:30:00.195-04:00","updated_at":"2023-05-18T14:20:45.272-04:00"}}
