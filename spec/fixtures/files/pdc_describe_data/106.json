{"resource":{"titles":[{"title":"Linear gyrokinetic simulations of microinstabilities within the pedestal region of H-mode NSTX discharges in a highly shaped geometry","title_type":null}],"description":"Linear (local) gyrokinetic predictions of edge microinstabilities in highly shaped, lithiated and non-lihiated NSTX discharges are reported using the gyrokinetic code GS2. Microtearing modes dominate the non-lithiated pedestal top. The stabilization of these modes at the lithiated pedestal top enables the electron temperature pedestal to extend further inwards, as observed experimentally. Kinetic ballooning modes are found to be unstable mainly at the mid-pedestal of both types of discharges, with unstable trapped electron modes nearer the separatrix region. At electron wavelengths, ETG modes are found to be unstable from mid-pedestal outwards for eta(e,exp)~2.2, with higher growth rates for the lithiated discharge. Near the separatrix, the critical temperature gradient for driving ETG modes is reduced in the presence of lithium, reflecting the reduction of the lithiated density gradients observed experimentally. A preliminary linear study in the edge of non-lithiated discharges shows that the equilibrium shaping alters the electrostatic modes stability, found more unstable at high plasma shaping.","collection_tags":[],"creators":[{"value":"Coury, M.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"M.","family_name":"Coury","identifier":null,"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":0},{"value":"Guttenfelder, W.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"W.","family_name":"Guttenfelder","identifier":{"value":"0000-0001-8181-058X","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":1},{"value":"Mikkelsen, D.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"D.","family_name":"Mikkelsen","identifier":{"value":"0000-0003-0865-3703","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":2},{"value":"Canik, J.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"J.","family_name":"Canik","identifier":null,"affiliations":[],"sequence":3},{"value":"Canal, G.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"G.","family_name":"Canal","identifier":null,"affiliations":[],"sequence":4},{"value":"Diallo, A.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"A.","family_name":"Diallo","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-0706-060X","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":5},{"value":"Kaye, S.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"S.","family_name":"Kaye","identifier":{"value":"0000-0002-2514-1163","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":6},{"value":"Kramer, G.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"G.","family_name":"Kramer","identifier":{"value":"0000-0001-5105-8139","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":7},{"value":"Maingi, R.","name_type":"Personal","given_name":"R.","family_name":"Maingi","identifier":{"value":"0000-0003-1238-8121","scheme":"ORCID","scheme_uri":"https://orcid.org"},"affiliations":[{"value":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","identifier":"https://ror.org/03vn1ts68","scheme":"ROR","scheme_uri":null}],"sequence":8}],"resource_type":"Dataset","resource_type_general":"Dataset","publisher":"Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University","publication_year":"2016","ark":"ark:/88435/dsp01n870zt23w","doi":"10.11578/1367078","rights_many":[{"identifier":"CC BY","uri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"}],"version_number":"1","related_objects":[{"related_identifier":"10.1063/1.4954911","related_identifier_type":"DOI","relation_type":"IsCitedBy","valid_type_values":["ARK","arXiv","bibcode","DOI","EAN13","EISSN","Handle","ISBN","ISSN","ISTC","LISSN","LSID","PMID","PURL","UPC","URL","URN","IGSN","w3id"],"valid_related_identifier_type":true,"valid_relationship_types":["IsCitedBy","Cites","IsSupplementTo","IsSupplementedBy","IsContinuedBy","Continues","HasMetadata","IsMetadataFor","IsNewVersionOf","IsPreviousVersionOf","HasVersion","IsVersionOf","IsPartOf","HasPart","IsReferencedBy","References","IsDocumentedBy","Documents","IsCompiledBy","Compiles","IsVariantFormOf","IsOriginalFormOf","IsIdenticalTo","IsReviewedBy","Reviews","IsDerivedFrom","IsSourceOf","IsObsoletedBy","Obsoletes","IsDescribedBy","Describes","IsRequiredBy","Requires"],"valid_relation_type":true,"errors":[]}],"keywords":["Local linear gyrokinetic simulations","NSTX"],"contributors":[],"organizational_contributors":[],"funders":[{"ror":"https://ror.org/01bj3aw27","funder_name":"United States Department of Energy","award_number":"DE-AC02-09CH11466","award_uri":""}],"domains":["Natural Sciences"],"communities":["Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory"],"subcommunities":["NSTX","Spherical Torus"],"migrated":true},"files":[{"filename":"10.11578/1367078/106/ARK_DATA.zip","size":107337,"display_size":"105 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.11578/1367078/106/ARK_DATA.zip"},{"filename":"10.11578/1367078/106/readme.txt","size":1544,"display_size":"1.51 KB","url":"https://g-ef94ef.f0ad1.36fe.data.globus.org/10.11578/1367078/106/readme.txt"}],"group":{"title":"Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL)","description":null,"code":"PPPL","created_at":"2022-04-28T16:30:00.195-04:00","updated_at":"2023-05-18T14:20:45.272-04:00"}}
